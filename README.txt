
Yes, I wish I had more time, 

but I had SO much fun making this!
 


Description: 
------------

Type the name of any of the Original 151 Pokemon into the search bar,
and watch that beautiful creature show up on the screen of your pokedex.
Take things to the next level by clicking on the red Info (i) Button to
reveal some startling information about the Pokemon.



Still in the Backlog:
---------------------

- I also wanted to implement an "Original 151" page.
  It would be collection of all the pokemon for users to 
  scroll and search through.


Final Thoughts:
---------------

Unfortunately I think I overestimated my javascript abilities, 
because this took much longer than anticipated.

HOWEVER, I know I could have done this faster in Vue. 
AND I know I could implement everything I intended, given a few more hours. 

Thanks so much for your time, and I hope you enjoy searching for pokemon.
